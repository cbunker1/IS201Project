        <h2>2024-2025 BYU Cougar Football Team</h2>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="container">
        <p>This year's BYU football team will likely go down in history as one of the greatest teams to ever play at the university. Although this sentance may sound great, BYU fans were left wanting just a tad bit more out of this team. With the implementation of the 12 team playoff and BYU being projected to make the cut towards the end of the year, everything was looking up. Unfortunately for BYU, two straight losses to Kansas and Arizona St would keep them from making the playoff. So what happened? This collapse was one that a BYU fan like myself saw coming but it could've easily been avoided. A Pooch punt against Kansas and a terrible first half performance was what did the cougars in at the end of the day. Although I can say I enjoyed watching this BYU team exceed expectaions this season, I'm left wondering what could've been. </p>
